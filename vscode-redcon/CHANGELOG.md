# Changelog

## 0.9.0 - 2026-07-11

### Added

- Brand new analytics dashboard implementing the Redcon Analytics
  design handoff: brand gradient banner with the redcon lockup, a
  cumulative savings hero with per-run trend, four KPI cards with
  budget threshold ticks and risk states, donut panels for budget and
  strategy share, a shared-scale token impact chart and side-by-side
  packed context / file rankings tables.
- New settings, all live-reactive:
  - `redcon.display.primaryMetric` (`tokens` | `dollars`) swaps which
    number leads in the hero and the saved-this-run KPI.
  - `redcon.budget.policy` (`auto-raise` | `strict-cap` | `ask-first`)
    drives the budget card footnote and the high-risk note.
  - `redcon.display.dataAccent` (`red` default, `blue`, `violet`,
    `crimson`, `wine`, `gradient`) recolors all data marks; chrome red
    and status colors stay fixed.
  - `redcon.costPerMillionTokens` converts saved tokens into dollars.
- Status bar shows tokens saved next to budget usage after a run.

### Notes

- Telegraf display font is referenced with a system-stack fallback but
  NOT bundled: the Pangram Pangram license must be verified before
  shipping the OTF files inside the extension.
- Run history now records tokens saved per run (drives the hero and
  trend). Dashboard HTML rendering lives in a pure module
  (`webview/dashboardHtml.ts`) with no vscode dependency, verified by
  rendering both themes and all accent presets in Chromium.

## 0.8.0 - 2026-04-27

### Added (delivered by the underlying Redcon CLI)

- Five new cmd-side compressors the extension's `Redcon: Run Command`
  workflow now picks up automatically: `kubectl_events`, `profiler`
  (py-spy + perf collapsed-stack), `json_log` (NDJSON schema-mining),
  `coverage` (coverage report), `sql_explain` (Postgres + MySQL TREE),
  and `bundle_stats` (webpack + esbuild metafiles). Total now 16
  compressors visible to the dashboard's per-schema reduction view.
- Cross-call session dimension:
  - V41 path aliases collapse repeated paths to short `f001` form
  - V43 reference ledger replaces repeated paragraph blocks with
    session-stable `{ref:001}` markers
  - V47 snapshot-delta dispatcher with schema-aware renderers for
    pytest (set-diff over failure names), git_diff (file-set diff),
    and coverage (per-file pp moves)
  - V49 symbol aliases collapse repeated CamelCase / snake_case
    identifiers to `c001`
  - V93 invariant-cert sha-prefix stamped on COMPACT/VERBOSE outputs
- V85 adversarial GA fuzzer covers all 16 compressor schemas as a
  hard CI gate when `REDCON_V85_ENFORCE=1`.

  ecosystem; no breaking surface changes in the extension itself.

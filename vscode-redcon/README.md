# Redcon - Token Savings for AI Coding Agents

Deterministic context budgeting for AI coding agents. Rank, compress, and pack repository context under explicit token limits - and watch how many tokens (and dollars) redcon saves you, directly in your editor.

## Features

### Savings panel

The activity bar view leads with what matters: cumulative tokens and
dollars saved, a per-run trend, and your last run - one click opens the
full dashboard. Below it, a live run feed: every run shows the tokens
that actually went to the agent against the gray would-be total, the
cut percentage, age and a risk dot. Click any run to inspect it.

### Plug and play: agent runs appear by themselves

Runs arrive automatically. Whenever an agent (Claude Code, Cursor,
Windsurf, Codex, Gemini) or the CLI packs context, redcon mirrors the
run report into `.redcon/runs/` and the extension picks it up live -
panel, status bar and dashboard update with zero clicking. Manual packs
live in the view title bar and the command palette.

### Analytics dashboard

Brand-new in 0.9.0, implementing the Redcon Analytics design:

- cumulative savings hero with per-run trend and dollar estimate
- KPI cards with budget threshold ticks and quality risk states
- budget utilization and strategy share donuts
- shared-scale token impact chart (packed vs saved per file)
- packed context and file rankings tables
- light and dark theme aware; six data accent presets

### Status bar, decorations, CodeLens

- live token usage and tokens saved in the status bar
- relevance score badges on files in the Explorer
- compression strategy and savings above each packed file:
  `Redcon: snippet | 400/1200 tok (-67%)`

## Getting started

1. Install this extension.
2. Install the CLI: `pip install redcon`
3. In your project: `redcon init` - one command registers the MCP
   server for your agents, installs hooks and writes `redcon.toml`.
   (The extension's setup checklist can do this for you too.)
4. Work normally. Runs land in the panel by themselves.

"""Selection-savings reporting (A1).

The "saved" budget number only counts in-file compression, which is frequently
zero. Redcon's real win is picking a subset of files, so a run reports a
selection baseline - what dumping the whole scanned universe would cost - so the
value delivered is visible even when no in-file compression happened.

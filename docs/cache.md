# Cache

Redcon is local-first by default. The open-source build ships cache backend abstractions so the pack pipeline can stay stable as teams add stricter trust boundaries or future shared cache integrations.

## Built-in Backends

- `local_file`: default backend. Persists summary previews to `.redcon_cache.json` inside the repo.
- `redis`: production-ready shared cache cluster backend. Stores compressed context entries in Redis with configurable TTL and namespace isolation.
- `shared_stub`: no-op shared/remote backend stub. It exercises the shared-cache interface without making network calls or persisting hosted state.
- `memory`: process-local backend intended for tests and advanced embedders.

## Local Cache

The default backend stores summary previews on disk and reuses them on later runs. This keeps OSS behavior local, deterministic, and inspectable.

```toml
[cache]
backend = "local_file"
summary_cache_enabled = true
cache_file = ".redcon_cache.json"
duplicate_hash_cache_enabled = true
```

`run.json` records cache details in a top-level `cache` block:

```json
{
  "cache": {
    "backend": "local_file",
    "enabled": true,
    "hits": 3,
    "misses": 1,
    "writes": 1
  },
  "cache_hits": 3
}
```

`cache_hits` remains as a compatibility field for existing consumers.

## Redis Shared Cache Cluster

The `redis` backend enables multiple agents or CI runs to share cached summaries, context slices, and compressed fragments across machines.

```toml
[cache]
backend = "redis"
redis_url = "redis://your-redis-host:6379/0"
redis_namespace = "myorg:myrepo"
redis_ttl_seconds = 86400
```

Install the extra dependency:

```
pip install "redcon[redis]"
```

### Cache key structure

Keys embed repository, file path, symbol, and content hash so that multiple agents working on the same codebase share entries without collisions:

```python
from redcon.cache import build_redis_cache_key

key = build_redis_cache_key(
    org="myorg",
    repo="backend",
    file_path="src/auth.py",
    symbol_or_slice="def login",
    content_hash=sha256(content.encode()).hexdigest(),
)
cache.get_fragment(key)
```

### Stored entry types

| Type | Store prefix | Description |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| Symbol summaries | `s:` | Compressed prose summaries of individual symbols |
| Context slices | `c:` | Verbatim or summarized slices of file regions |
| Compressed fragments | `f:` | Reusable compressed context fragments |

All values are zlib-compressed before storage.

### TTL and invalidation

TTL is set per entry via `redis_ttl_seconds` (default 86400 s / 24 h). Set to `0` to store without expiry.

Explicit invalidation:

```python
# Remove one logical key across all stores
backend.invalidate("fragment:src/auth.py:10-30:abc123")

# Remove every entry in this backend's namespace (e.g. after a force-push)
backend.invalidate_namespace()
```

### Metrics

The `cache` block in `run.json` includes per-store counters:

```json
{
  "cache": {
    "backend": "redis",
    "enabled": true,
    "hits": 5,
    "misses": 2,
    "writes": 2,
    "tokens_saved": 840,
    "fragment_hits": 3,
    "fragment_misses": 1,
    "fragment_writes": 1,
    "slice_hits": 2,
    "slice_misses": 1,
    "slice_writes": 1
  }
}
```

## Future Shared Cache Direction

`shared_stub` exists to make the cache boundary explicit today without shipping hosted infrastructure. It deliberately behaves as a deterministic miss-only backend:

- no network calls
- no hidden background sync
- no hosted service dependency
- no implicit trust expansion

Future team-level reuse can plug into the same backend interface under `redcon/cache/` without changing CLI contracts or the `run.json` artifact shape.

## Trust And Privacy

Cache entries are derived from repository contents. Treat them as sensitive code-adjacent data.

- Keep `local_file` when repository data must remain on the current machine.
- Only adopt a future shared backend if the cache operator is allowed to see the same repository content as the developers using it.
- Telemetry and cache are separate systems. Telemetry stays opt-in, disabled by default, and has no network sink in OSS.
- The shared-cache stub in OSS sends nothing anywhere.

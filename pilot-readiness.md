## What is Alpha / Beta

### Alpha - Not Recommended for Production Use
| Feature | Status | Why |
|---------|--------|-----|
| Redis cache backend | ⚠️ Alpha | Limited production validation; no cluster support |
| `observe` command (metrics persistence) | ⚠️ Alpha | Schema may change |
| `visualize` HTML dependency graph | ⚠️ Alpha | Best-effort; layout issues on large repos |
| Node.js runner integration | ⚠️ Alpha | Wrapper only; limited testing |
| Plugin system | ⚠️ Alpha | API may change between minor versions |

### Beta - Functional but Not Load-Tested
| Feature | Status | Why |
|---------|--------|-----|
| Multi-turn agent runtime | 🔶 Beta | Session isolation under concurrent load not fully validated |
| Summarization stage | 🔶 Beta | Quality varies significantly by file type and LLM |
| Dashboard web UI (Next.js) | 🔶 Beta | No auth; dev-only use |
| Benchmark dataset builder | 🔶 Beta | Output format may evolve |
| PR audit command | 🔶 Beta | Requires clean git history |

## Known Limitations

### Scale
- **No horizontal scaling** for the gateway: sessions are in-memory, so `/run-agent-step` multi-turn sessions are node-local. Use `/prepare-context` (stateless) if you need load-balanced deployments.
- **PostgreSQL single-node**: the cloud service uses a single Postgres instance. For >100 req/s event ingestion, add a connection pooler (PgBouncer) in front.
- **No message queue**: webhook delivery is synchronous in the gateway. Under high load, slow webhook endpoints will add latency to gateway responses.

### Security
- **`POST /orgs` is unauthenticated**: org creation is a bootstrap endpoint. In production, block it at the network level (nginx `deny all` except internal IPs).
- **No rate limiting on event ingestion**: the cloud API has no built-in rate limiting per API key. Add nginx `limit_req` for unauthenticated `/events` calls.
- **Webhook secrets are hashed, not stored**: the raw secret is never recoverable after creation. Customers must save it on first creation.

### Observability
- **No built-in metrics endpoint** (Prometheus/OpenMetrics): add a `/metrics` exporter for production monitoring.
- **Structured logging only in gateway**: the cloud service logs via uvicorn defaults. Ship logs to a log aggregator (Datadog, CloudWatch, Loki) for production alerting.

### Features Not Yet Built
- **Multi-region / data residency**: all data is in a single Postgres instance with no sharding.
- **SSO / SAML / OIDC**: authentication is API-key only. No OAuth2 login flow.
- **Usage quotas and billing meters**: the control plane tracks usage but has no quota enforcement or billing hooks.
- **Slack / PagerDuty webhook templates**: webhooks deliver raw JSON; no platform-specific adapters yet.
- **SDK for non-Python runtimes**: only Python SDK provided. TypeScript SDK is not yet available.

## Recommended Deployment Model for Pilot Customers

### Smallest viable pilot (1-3 teams)

```
[Developer Machine / CI]
  └─ redcon CLI (pip install redcon)
       ├─ cb pack / cb roi / cb benchmark-report
       └─ GitHub Action (action.yml in repo)

[Single VPS or ECS task, 2 vCPU / 1 GB RAM]
  └─ redcon-cloud (docker-compose.prod.yml)
       ├─ FastAPI (uvicorn, 2 workers)
       ├─ PostgreSQL 16
       └─ nginx (TLS termination)
```

**Setup steps:**
1. `pip install redcon` on developer machines or in CI.
2. Run `redcon init` in each repo to generate `redcon.toml`.
3. Deploy `redcon-cloud` using `docker-compose.prod.yml`.
4. Run migrations (automatically applied via Docker init scripts).
5. Create an org: `POST /orgs` → note the `id`.
6. Issue an API key: `POST /orgs/{id}/api-keys` → save the `raw_key`.
7. Set `RC_GATEWAY_CLOUD_API_KEY` and `RC_GATEWAY_CLOUD_POLICY_URL` on developer machines.
8. Add the GitHub Action to CI repos.

### What to show in a pilot demo

1. **ROI report**: run `cb roi` across a week of PR pack runs → show tokens saved and USD saved.
2. **Benchmark report**: run `cb benchmark-report` on a real pack artifact → share the markdown with stakeholders.
3. **`/dashboard/roi` endpoint**: wire to a simple HTML page or Retool dashboard.
4. **GitHub Action step summary**: open any merged PR and click the Redcon step → tokens saved and $ saved visible inline.
5. **Policy gate**: set a `max_estimated_input_tokens` limit and open a PR that exceeds it → CI fails with a clear policy violation message.

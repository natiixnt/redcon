"""Pro entitlement resolution and feature gating (open-core).

The redcon core is free and stays dependency-free. Paid ("Pro") features - the
savings dashboard, cross-agent history, prompt-optimization insights - are
unlocked by a signed license key that redcon-cloud issues on purchase.

Design:

- Verification is OFFLINE. The core embeds only the Ed25519 *public* key; the
  private key never leaves redcon-cloud, so Pro works on a plane and never
  phones home.
- A license is UNFORGEABLE without the private key, so "holds a valid license"
  is proof of purchase - even though the local gate itself, being open source,
  can always be patched out by a determined user. The real paid value lives
  server-side in redcon-cloud; the local gate only stops casual bypass, which
  is the honest ceiling for any open-core license.
- Signature verification needs ``cryptography``, shipped in the optional
  ``pro`` extra. Free installs never pull it. If a license is present but the
  library is missing, we degrade to free and tell the user how to fix it
  rather than granting an unverifiable Pro.
- Until redcon-cloud mints the production keypair, the embedded public key is
  empty. With no key configured, every license is treated as unverified and
  the user stays free - the correct pre-launch state.
